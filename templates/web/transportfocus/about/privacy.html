</h2>

<ul>
    <li>We send a copy of your report to Highways England. This
        <a href="https://highwaysengland.co.uk/privacy/">privacy policy</a>
        explains how Highways England will handle your information.</li>

    <li>Transport Focus may use any information you provide in this form,
        including photographs, in our work on behalf of road users and we may
        contact you about this.</li>

    <li>
        When Highways England or Transport Focus responds to your report,
        <b>the reply will go directly to your email inbox</b>. This response,
        and any subsequent correspondence, happens outside the Sort My Sign
        system.

        We only ever send you emails in relation to your reports or use of the site.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>
    Legal basis for processing
</h2>

<p>
    In using Sort My Sign for any of the functions listed above, we are
    processing your data under the legal basis 6(1)(f) – legitimate interests.
    We assert that there is a legitimate consumer interest in giving people an
    easy and public way to report sign problems. The benefits of reporting
    issues publicly are that others can quickly see what has already been
    reported, so it prevents the body from having to deal with duplicates. It
    also creates a snapshot for road users, so it's easy to see what the
    common issues are in a given area.

    Retention periods and your right to removal
</h2>

<h3>
    Reports
</h3>

<p>
    Except in exceptional circumstances, we do not delete reports made through
    Sort My Sign. You can anonymise reports so that there is no public
    connection between the content and your name. You can do this by logging in
    to your account and clicking on the ‘“Hide your name” link beside the time
    and date of your report. From here you may anonymise this report or all
    reports you have made. However, if you ask for a report to be removed we
    will remove it.
</p>

<h3>

</h3>

<p>
    As well as your report or update appearing on the Sort My Sign website, your details,
    including name and email address, are stored in our administration system.
</p>

<p>
    If you submit a report but do not click on the confirmation email, your
    report will not be sent to Highways England; however, the report and your
    details remain in our system and are accessible to site administrators.
</p>

<p>
    Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you would like your details to be removed from our admin
    database.
</p>

<h3>
    Support mail
</h3>

<p>
    If you contact Transport Focus via our support email address we keep your
    message for up to three years before deleting it. This is to aid
    continuity and so that we can view any historic context which may have
    bearing on subsequent support mail, even if members of the support staff
    change. Support staff adhere to internal privacy policies which may be
    viewed on request.
